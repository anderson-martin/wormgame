# Worm Game


I have accomplished both courses of "Object-Oriented Programming with Java" offered by Helsinki University. I solved all assignments (+150) offered by them. One of them was developing a Worm game. I have uploaded my answer on github. 


To play the game, start it from an IDE and use arrow keys (↑ ↓ →	←) to move the worm. Once worm runs into itself or wall, game stops and you have to restart the game.
