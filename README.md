# Worm Game


To play the game, start it from an IDE (I used Netbeans) and use arrow keys (↑ ↓ →	←) to move the worm. Once worm runs into itself or wall, game stops and you have to restart the game. 


Following is screenshot of how the wormgame looks like. Its obvious that the worm looks for the bait and gets bigger and bigger....

I have accomplished both courses of "Object-Oriented Programming with Java" offered by Helsinki University. I solved all assignments (+150) offered by them. One of them was developing a Worm game. I have uploaded my answer on github.
